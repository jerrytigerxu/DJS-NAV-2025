- Organized Notes:
  - Major highlights and challenges: successfully transitioned from CTO to CEO | navigated the company through the changes of the past few years | built a successful company from the ground up with Nick | learned a lot about the insurance industry and building a business | **recently hired a marketing team to help with this aspect of the business**
  - Key lessons: It's important to be cautiously optimistic as a CEO | The CEO needs to be able to think strategically and delegate effectively | it's important to have a strong team in place to support the CEO
  - Future goals: sign more trucking clients | offer alternative pricing models for the product | overhaul the UI/UX of the product | incorporate AI into the product in the future | incorporating telemetry products in commercial and personal vehicles to gather data and utilize that for underwriting data
  - Potential challenges: the economy may not be as strong as expected | the trucking industry may not be as receptive to new technology as hoped | the UI/UX overhaul may be difficult given the legacy code | incorporating AI into the product could be complicated

- Raw Notes: just hired a "marketing team" to help out with this aspect of the business stack | in a bit of a slump but looking forward to growth | Matt is also in charge of managing Nick's estate and closing the "affairs of his life" and that has been quite frustrating | CEO spends much more time thinking and delegating than on hands-on stuff (relinquishing a lot of control which is hard since the system is his "baby") | Don is "excellent" as CTO is their AWS expert | MT was heavily inspired by 9-11 and the impact on the insurance industry (that was when Nick and Matt partnered) -> Matt got to learn a lot about insurance and about building things up from the ground early on | it took a few years to become profitable | it's important as a CEO to be "cautiously optimistic" | Matt definitely is willing to share a lot of details and is willing to spend a lot of time to talk (has a tendency to go on tangents) and clearly knows a lot | he is optimistic about the economy, especially the trucking industry -> wants to sign more trucking clients | very excited about signing new clients (and about having different delivery and licensing models for the product going forward -> considering offering alternative pricing methods like allowing clients more control ("perpetual license") | Matt considers himself very strong in writing | telemetry products in commercial and personal vehicles -> getting data from the vehicles and utilizing that for the underwriting data to create a "rating event" | incorporating AI in the future potentially | Matt is a Star Trek fan | one big challenge -> UI/UX overhaul (he believes is long overdue) -> wants to make the system more feature-rich to give clients something better and to make the product more usable -> one hindrance is that the original product was written BEFORE many of the Internet standards and before many frameworks (victim of being early) -> so there is a TON of legacy code | Matt has the ability to keep many things in his head and code hundreds of lines without needing to test much | had to rewrite a lot of the API layer in 2018 to transfer to Node.js | committed to Vue.js for the frontend
