## 3 most important topics or events
- The passing of their former CEO Nick Teetelli at the end of 2022 was a big hit to the company
- They seem very “low-key” in the industry, with no new news/events/press since the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020)
   - There is an issue with the “News & Events” page where the links to ITA Pro are not updated  (leads to itapro.org (domain from GoDaddy no longer used by the company and is for sale) | it seems like the company used to be much more involved with events and conventions but has dipped in activity since 2020
- Important “breakthroughs” for the company - new APIs for the Aspire Suite (2018) and the company’s migration to AWS (2019) | media release from St. Nick Media Services (Jennifer Overhulse)
   - Benefits of AWS: improved data security (protecting policyholders’ personal identifiable information, guaranteed uptime (won’t crash), and better disaster recovery capabilities
   - How the Aspire Suite works - available as a pre-integrated suite or as standalone components
    - Core: Aspire Policy + Billing + Claims
    - Aspire Underwriting
