## P/O statement
Maple Tech has been in a "slump" as of recently, though they are optimistic regarding future growth because of 1) the rising trend of the economy, and 2) the many changes that will be taking place in the company. Matthew Blackley, CEO of Maple Tech, has multiple goals for the near future, including: signing more clients from the trucking industry, offering alternative pricing models for the product, incorporating AI into the product, and incorporating telemetry products in commercial and personal vehicles to gather data for more effective underwriting. However, the biggest and most important change concerns the company's business stack, particularly their marketing efforts. 

"We are working on drastically improving our market visibility with the insurance community. We are working closely with a firm that specializes in insurance vendor marketing...the firm offers the services we need...We recognize that our marketing approaches have become a little stale, and are no longer as effective as they used to be, so we are working on expanding our name recognition throughout the industry."

This is a very positive development, as the marketing firm will be able to help the company very much in much of the company's marketing efforts, especially in the UI/UX overhaul matter that is also very important. 

However, in order to bring Maple Tech out of the "slump" and into a "new age of growth", there are other matters that must be factored into the equation. => market research + marketing channel optimization is not enough to drive business growth -> there are at least three matters that I believe are also highly important that are not addressed by the marketing firm:

1) Targeting/qualifying (especially for finding prospective clients in other industries like trucking) -> Develop a more sophisticated lead generation and qualification system that leverages data analytics (and automation) to identify and prioritize high-potential prospects 
2) Sales backend + data management ->Create a centralized, interactive dashboard and data pipeline (particularly for DAPS (analytics, presentation, science)) that provides real-time insights into sales performance, pipeline health, and client engagement
3) Account development and onboarding experience -> Develop a personalized custom onboarding and support portal that provides a seamless and engaging experience for new clients + DevOps pipeline for continuous (PAC) improvement of the system
